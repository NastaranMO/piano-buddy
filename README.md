# Piano Buddy

Piano Buddy is an interactive, turn-based web application that blends user-generated piano melodies with AI-enhanced musical accompaniment. Using Magenta Music's RNN and PianoGenie, it offers a distinctive musical experience where users play the piano and the AI responds with complementary melodies.

## Features

- Turn-based interactive musical experience.
- User plays piano notes, followed by AI-generated music based on user input.
- Real-time AI music generation using Magenta Music RNN and PianoGenie.
- Customizable settings for diverse musical experiences.
- Responsive design for various devices.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js
- npm (Node Package Manager)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/NastaranMO/piano-buddy.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd piano-buddy
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. Build the JavaScript bundle:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
5. Start the server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Usage

Open `http://localhost:8081` in a web browser after starting the server. Begin by playing notes on the virtual piano; the AI then generates a melody based on your input.

## Code Structure

- `public/`: Contains static assets like CSS, images, and the JavaScript bundle generated from the `src` folder using `uglify-js`.
- `src/`: Source JavaScript files for the application.
- `server.js`: Sets up the Express server.
- `package.json`: Defines project metadata and dependencies.

## Sequence Diagrams

### User-Initiated Melody

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    actor User as User
    participant Buddy as Piano Buddy
    participant Genie as PianoGenie
    participant Seq as Music Sequencer
    participant Player as Player
    
    User->>Buddy: Initiates by pressing a key on the virtual piano 
    Buddy->>Genie: Requests the next note from the PianoGenie
    Genie->>Buddy: Provides the next musical note
    Buddy->>Seq: Stores the received note for future reference
    Buddy->>Player: Sends the note to the Player for playback
    Player->>User: Plays the note, allowing the User to hear it

```

### AI-Generated Melody Continuation

```mermaid

    loop Repeat until user provides positive feedback
      actor User as User
      participant Buddy as Piano Buddy
      participant RNN as MusicRNN
      participant Seq as Music Sequencer
      participant Player as Player
      
      Buddy->>Seq: Requests a list of notes played by the user in their last turn
      Seq->>Buddy: Returns the list of notes
      Buddy->>RNN: Provides the list of played notes and requests the generation of a musical continuation
      RNN->>Buddy: Returns the generated notes
      Buddy->>Player: Sends the generated notes one by one for playback
      Player->>User: Plays the notes, allowing the User to hear the musical continuation
      User->>Buddy: Provides Feedback 
    end
