## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js
- npm (Node Package Manager)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/NastaranMO/piano-buddy.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd piano-buddy
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
